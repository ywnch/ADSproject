### Events Data
- Get all the 2016 events in Barclays Center via Facebook API.
  The data in Barclays Center Website (http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/) is in html and difficult to collect. So choose    to use the events in Barclays Center's FB page.
  
  Two concerns:
  1. There is no end time in both FB and Official Web.
  2. There is no categories in FB data.

- Find a list of 2016 concerts in Barclays Center in Wiki, which has "Tickets Sold" info.
